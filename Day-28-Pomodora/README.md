**Introduction**
---------------

The Pomodoro Timer Project is a simple yet effective time management tool that helps users stay focused and productive.
The project is built using Python and the Tkinter library, providing a user-friendly graphical interface.

**Features**
------------

* **Pomodoro Technique**: Work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break.
* **Customizable**: Adjust the work and break intervals to suit your needs.
* **Notification Sounds**: Receive audio notifications when the timer starts and ends.
* **Simple and Intuitive Interface**: Easy to use and navigate, even for those new to the Pomodoro Technique.

**Requirements**
---------------

* **Python 3.x**: The project is built using Python 3.x and is not compatible with Python 2.x.
* **Tkinter**: The Tkinter library is required for the graphical interface.
* **Winsound** (Windows only): The winsound module is required for audio notifications on Windows.
* **Simpleaudio** (optional): The simpleaudio library is required for cross-platform audio notifications.

**Installation**
---------------

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/pomodoro-timer.git`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the project: `python main.py`

**Usage**
---------

1. Launch the application: `python main.py`
2. Click the "Start" button to begin the Pomodoro timer.
3. Work on your task without any distractions during the 25-minute work interval.
4. Take a 5-minute break when the timer ends.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a total of 4-6 "Pomodoros" per session.

**Code Structure**
-----------------

The project consists of the following files:

* `main.py`: The main application file, containing the Tkinter interface and Pomodoro logic.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of required libraries for the project.
* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and usage instructions.

**Customization**
----------------

* **Work and Break Intervals**: Adjust the `WORK_MIN` and `BREAK_MIN` variables in `main.py` to customize the Pomodoro
  intervals.
* **Notification Sounds**: Replace the `winsound.Beep()` function with your own audio notification code or use the
  `simpleaudio` library for cross-platform support.

**Troubleshooting**
------------------

* **Audio Notifications**: Ensure that the `winsound` module is installed on Windows or the `simpleaudio` library is
  installed for cross-platform support.
* **Interface Issues**: Check that the Tkinter library is installed and functioning correctly.
